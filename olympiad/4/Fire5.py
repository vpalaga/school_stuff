    find the time for fire1(f1) to connect with fire2(f2):

    Answer key: time for Fire to get point A = minimal path distance from F to A

    1)  find the x y components of the difference : |x1-x2|, |y1-y2|
    2)  subtract 1 from each component to get rid of the corner,
        and the abs() does deal with cases where y or x component is 0: 0-1 = -1 -> 1
    3)  we can assign each number from x y components to the f1->f2 path,
        but as we will notice there is allways one path piece missing in the x or y component
        so we add it back as well we add the components together to add the total path distance,
    4)  We have to divide the distance by 2 since the fire is spreading from both sides.
    5)  In case distance is odd: (distance mod 2 == 1), we have to get rid of the 1 path piece we added since we cannot
        pass through path tiles diagonally, I do this by rounding DOWN to nearest integer.
        (be careful when using round() with n + 0.5, the output is a result "bankerâ€™s rounding")
